# Rust Tetris using Macroquad
A Tetris game in Rust using the [Macroquad game engine](https://macroquad.rs/). This is still a work in progress. The code needs A LOT of tidying up.

Next on the list to add is scoring and speeding up of game

The pieces rotation is still a bit glitchy but that seems to be game engine related.
